# SQL Repository

This repository is a collection of SQL scripts, queries, and examples designed to demonstrate SQL capabilities, database management techniques, and to assist developers in understanding and writing efficient SQL code. The scripts provided here cover various SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, and focus on a wide range of topics from basic CRUD operations to complex queries involving joins, indexes, and optimizations.

## Contents

- `basic-queries/` - Contains SQL scripts for basic database operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- `joins-and-aggregations/` - Examples of different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and aggregation queries using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
- `schema-design/` - SQL scripts for creating and modifying database schemas including table creation, altering table structures, and setting up constraints.
- `indexing/` - Demonstrations of how to create and use indexes to improve query performance.
- `stored-procedures/` - Examples of stored procedures, functions, and how to use them in SQL.
- `data-migration/` - Scripts to assist with data migration between different databases or within the same database.
- `performance-optimization/` - Tips and scripts for optimizing SQL queries for better performance.
- `sample-databases/` - Sample database scripts for practicing SQL queries.
- `advanced-queries/` - Contains complex SQL queries that deal with subqueries, window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and more.
- `tests/` - SQL tests for validating the integrity and performance of SQL queries.

## Prerequisites

Before running these scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
- An appropriate SQL database server such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.
- A SQL client to run and manage your SQL queries, such as DBeaver, pgAdmin, or the command line interface specific to your SQL server.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd sql-repo
   ```

3. (Optional) If using sample databases, load them into your SQL server:
   - For MySQL:
     ```sql
     source /path/to/sample-database/mysql_sample.sql;
     ```
   - For PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     psql -U username -d dbname -f /path/to/sample-database/postgres_sample.sql
     ```
   - For SQL Server:
     ```sql
     USE [master]
     GO
     :r /path/to/sample-database/sqlserver_sample.sql
     GO
     ```
